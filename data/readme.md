This folder needs to be populated, manually at the moment, with the "movies_metadata.csv" file.
Other intermediate data generated by the project, will also be saved under this folder. 

We could make this auto-populated - download using HTTP and unzip, on first use;
or using the kaggle Python library (https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) that makes these installs easier. 
Either way there are credentials to pass - here I assume manual download for now!

Given that the CSV is not enormous we could include it in the codebase, but I'm against including data 
inside a Git repo - data access and data versioning is a different thing.
