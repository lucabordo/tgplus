# Dependencies that are needed for the development, testing, and use of notebooks,
# but are not strictly needed when deploying the application. 

# We always include ipykernel as we'll usually want to make a kernel install 
# part of our default make init - so we can use notebook within the project's virtual environment:
ipykernel
nbformat
nbconvert

# Static analysis and code help tools:
pycodestyle
pydocstyle
pylint
autopep8
mypy

# Testing:
pytest
pytest-cov
