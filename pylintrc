# PYLINT CONFIGURATION - this configures the types of errors/warnings we want to detect using static analysis.
# Many more things can be set, see pylintrc examples on the web, e.g.:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/0eeb67749b6aa016db61d87e55a1f7a7e459b352/pylintrc#L142

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"
