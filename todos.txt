Assumptions:
- I focus only on English and deliberately ignore training points with other languages.

Limitations / Improvements:
- Usually I'd use training and test subsets of the data as well of course as *validation*;
  given the limited data and the training scenario I haven't used validation here

Embedding model:
- Consider various alternatives of models (we could make configurable...)
- Make the code parallel (it is, optionally, but no clear speed-up)
- Make the code GPU friendly (I worked on laptop only ATM)
- Remove the caching of embedding (if fast enough) or make simpler and 
  deal with invalidation depending on version (use joblib?...)

Minor stuff:
- Automated data loading instead of currently manual CSV load (see comments in data/readme)
- There is a warning not previously seen in notebook tests when running `make test`?
