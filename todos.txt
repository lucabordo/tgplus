Assumptions:
- I focus only on English and deliberately ignore training points with other languages.

Limitations / Improvements:
- Usually I'd use training and test subsets of the data as well of course as *validation*;
  given the limited data and the training scenario I haven't used validation here

Minor stuff:
- Automated data loading instead of currently manual CSV load (see comments in data/readme)
- There is a warning not previously seen in notebook tests when running `make test`?
